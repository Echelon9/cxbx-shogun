Cxbx
=============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Echelon9/cxbx-shogun.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Echelon9/cxbx-shogun)

A branch of the Cxbx source code.

This fork builds upon the SVN Cxbx in that it attempts to use modern
software development practices:

1. greater reliability through code robustness and automated testing. 
2. easier maintenance through code cleanliness.
3. easier to develop new features. 
4. easier to re-use code though code de-coupling and modularisation.

Further details to be specified in time.

## Developers

For now the code itself, 'doc/' folder and self-generated Doxygen documentation
are the best resources.

TravisCI is used to run automatic builds of a limited subset of functionality.
